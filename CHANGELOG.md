## [1.4.5] - 2025-06-15

### üîß Fixed - Full Preset Authentication

**Issue Resolved**: The `--preset=full` installation was not automatically including authentication, requiring users to manually run `php artisan bal:install --sass --auth`.

#### **What Was Fixed**

- **‚úÖ Full Preset Authentication**: Fixed configuration loading issue that prevented authentication from being installed with the full preset
- **‚úÖ Hardcoded Preset Configurations**: Moved preset configurations from config file to command class to ensure reliability during installation
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Installation Feedback**: Added clear messaging when authentication system is being installed
- **‚úÖ Improved Reliability**: Eliminated dependency on config system during installation process

#### **Technical Changes**

- **InstallCommand.php**: Added `getPresetConfigurations()` method with hardcoded preset definitions
- **InstallCommand.php**: Enhanced authentication installation with clear progress messaging
- **InstallCommand.php**: Improved preset handling to ensure consistent behavior

#### **User Experience**

- **Before**: `php artisan bal:install --preset=full` + `php artisan bal:install --sass --auth` (2 commands)
- **After**: `php artisan bal:install --preset=full` (1 command, includes everything)

#### **Installation Commands**

```bash
# Now works as expected - includes authentication automatically
php artisan bal:install --preset=full

# All presets work reliably:
php artisan bal:install --preset=minimal   # Bootstrap + Alpine only
php artisan bal:install --preset=standard  # + Livewire + SASS
php artisan bal:install --preset=full      # + Authentication (FIXED!)
```

#### **Verification**

The full preset now correctly installs:

- ‚úÖ Bootstrap 5.3+ with professional styling
- ‚úÖ Alpine.js for reactive components
- ‚úÖ Livewire 3 for dynamic functionality
- ‚úÖ 7-1 SASS architecture with organized stylesheets
- ‚úÖ **Complete authentication system** (login, register, password reset)
- ‚úÖ Air-gapped compatibility with no external dependencies

This ensures users get the complete BAL Kit experience with a single command as intended.
